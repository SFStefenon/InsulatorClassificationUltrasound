# Insulator Classification based on Ultrasound Detection

This dataset presents an ultrasound measurement performed in a high-voltage laboratory considering insulators in different conditions.

In the experiment was applied 7.95 kV voltage phase-to-ground, corresponding to 13.8 kV phase-to-phase in the electrical power system. 

An ultrasound detector is used to capture the ultrasound noise up to 500 kHz being positioned 0.4 m away from the insulator. Each insulator under evaluation had its signal recorded separately for 50 seconds.

Considering that the partial discharge typically happens in frequencies between 10 kHz and 210 kHz, this recorded time ensures that all necessary samples are captured. To standardize the evaluation 100,000 samples were considered. An example of this output is presented here (given 10,000 samples):
